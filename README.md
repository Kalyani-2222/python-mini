# python-mini projects
It contains python mini projects like the first one is demoji convertor
second one is python Timer

step by step explaination:

import time:
This imports Python's time module, which provides functions to work with time, such as time.sleep(). 
time.sleep(1) pauses the program for a specified number of seconds (in this case, 1 second).


def countdown(t)::
This defines a function named countdown that takes one parameter t (time in seconds). This function will be used to perform the countdown.


while t::
This is a while loop that keeps running as long as t is greater than zero. When t becomes 0, the loop will stop.


mins, secs = divmod(t, 60):
The divmod() function takes two arguments, divides them, and returns a tuple containing:
Quotient (mins): The number of full minutes (from dividing t by 60).
Remainder (secs): The remaining seconds after dividing t by 60.
For example, if t = 125, divmod(125, 60) will return (2, 5), meaning 2 minutes and 5 seconds.



timer = '{:02d}:{:02d}'.format(mins, secs):
This line formats the mins and secs as a string in the "MM:SS" format.
{:02d} means "format as a 2-digit decimal number, padding with a leading zero if necessary".
For example, if mins = 2 and secs = 5, it will create the string 02:05.


time.sleep(1):
This pauses the program for 1 second, which is what makes the countdown happen in real time.


t -= 1:
After this pause, the loop continues with t decremented by 1 until it becomes zero.


countdown(int(t)):
This calls the countdown() function with the user-provided value t (converted to an integer).
